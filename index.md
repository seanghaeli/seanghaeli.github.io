Mohammed is a fully autonomous, multi-robot system built for the 2018 Engineering Physics Mars Rover Robot Competition and Design Challenge.

# The Competition

The 2021 ENPH 253 competition was designed to be the most complicated and challenging robot competition over the 21-years that the course has been run.

The mission is to return soil sample vials stashed by the Perseverance rover during its 2021 mission, and our engineering team has been selected to develop a proof-of-concept prototype of a rover that will accomplish this task.

Our proof-of-concept robots will have to lower themselves to the ground via a sky-crane, making a gentle touchdown on the surface, and then autonomously search the surrounding area for sample containers. Once found, they will pick up the containers, which have been stashed horizontally, transport them to the return vehicle, and store them upright within the vehicle for return to earth.
